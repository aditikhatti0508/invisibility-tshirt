# Invisibility-tshirt

 This is a project I made using OpenCV, where I made invisibility T-shirt. This is how I did it.

 STEP 1 : Capture the frame

 STEP 2 : Convert the frames in HSV format

 STEP 3 : Generate the mask for color of T-shirt

 STEP 4 : Using bitwise add, create foreground and background

 STEP 5 : Add them both and create the final frame and display it
